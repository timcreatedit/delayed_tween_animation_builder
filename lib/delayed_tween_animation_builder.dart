  /// triggered at anytime by providing a new [Tween] with a new [Tween.end]
  /// value. The new animation runs from the current animation value (which may
  /// be [Tween.end] of the old [tween], if that animation completed) to
  /// [Tween.end] of the new [tween]. The [Tween.begin] value is ignored except
  /// for the initial animation that is triggered when the widget builds for the
  /// first time.
  ///
  /// Any (subclass of) [Tween] is accepted as an argument. For example, to
  /// animate the height or width of a [Widget], use a [Tween<double>], or
  /// check out the [ColorTween] to animate the color property of a [Widget].

  /// ## Ownership
  ///
  /// The [DelayedTweenAnimationBuilder] takes full ownership of the provided [Tween]
  /// and it will mutate the [Tween]. Once a [Tween] instance has been passed
  /// to [DelayedTweenAnimationBuilder] its properties should not be accessed or
  /// changed anymore to avoid any interference with the
  /// [DelayedTweenAnimationBuilder]. If you need to change the [Tween], create a
  /// **new instance** with the new values.
  ///
  /// It is good practice to never store a [Tween] provided to a
  /// [DelayedTweenAnimationBuilder] in an instance variable to avoid accidental
  /// modifications of the [Tween].

  /// The duration over which to animate the parameters.

  /// Called every time the animation value changes.

  /// The current animation value is passed to the builder along with the
  /// [child]. The builder should build a [Widget] based on the current
  /// animation value and incorporate the [child] into it, if it is non-null.
